# Titanic Survival Study — Gurunandhan “Guru” Pillai
**Questions.** Who survived more by gender/class/age? What simple patterns stand out?
**Data.** Public Titanic CSV.
**Approach.** Clean missing values → engineer FamilySize & AgeBand → groupby survival → simple charts → summarize.

## Three Insights
1) Female passengers show substantially higher survival than male passengers.
2) 1st class passengers have higher survival than 3rd class passengers.
3) Children/younger age bands tend to survive more than senior age bands.

## Files
- `titanic.ipynb` — runs end-to-end in Colab
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` — cleaned export
- `/assets` — charts used in the README and for quick portfolio screenshots

## Next Step
Try logistic regression or decision trees to predict survival and compare feature importance.
